# Secure Password and Passphrase Generator

This project provides a Python-based solution for generating secure passwords and BIP39 passphrases. It incorporates best practices in security, including the use of external entropy for enhanced randomness and a simple strength checker for generated passwords.

## Features

- **Random Password Generation**: Generates strong passwords with a mix of upper and lower case letters, digits, and special characters.
- **BIP39 Passphrase Generation**: Creates secure passphrases using the BIP39 wordlist, suitable for cryptographic applications.
- **Password Strength Checker**: Offers a basic assessment of password strength based on length and character diversity.
- **External Entropy**: Conceptual implementation for enhancing randomness using system or user-generated events.
